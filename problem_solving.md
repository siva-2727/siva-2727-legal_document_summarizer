#  DLL Load Failure - WinError 126

##  Problem Description

While running the Streamlit application that uses PyTorch and Transformers, the following error was encountered:

OSError: [WinError 126] The specified module could not be found. Error loading "fbgemm.dll" or one of its dependencies.

This error prevents the model (e.g., `facebook/bart-large-cnn`) from loading correctly in your environment.

---==========

##  Root Cause

The error typically indicates one of the following:

1. **Missing system dependencies**: PyTorch requires Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable on Windows.
2. **Corrupt or incompatible PyTorch installation**: Using a GPU-based PyTorch build without the proper CUDA setup, or the `.dll` files are missing.
3. **Environment misconfiguration**: Conflicts between packages or environments.

---

## Solution

### Step 1: Install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable

Download and install:

> [VC++ Redistributable (x64)](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)

---

### Step 2: Reinstall PyTorch with CPU Support

If you're not using a GPU, install the CPU-only build:

```bash
pip uninstall torch
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

---------------
Step 3: Verify the Installation
Try running the following in a Python shell:

import torch
print(torch.__version__)
print(torch.cuda.is_available())  # Should return False if CPU-only

----------------------
Optional: Clean Reinstall of All Packages
If the issue persists:

Remove your virtual environment

Recreate it:

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

------------------------
After Fix
Once these steps are complete, rerun your app:

streamlit run app.py
Your models should now load without any DLL-related issues.

Notes
If you plan to use GPU, install CUDA Toolkit and use pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121 (based on your CUDA version).

Always isolate your dependencies using virtual environments to avoid conflicts.
